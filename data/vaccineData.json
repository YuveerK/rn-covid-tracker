      "details": "Background: Pfizer and BioNtech are&nbsp;collaborating&nbsp;to develop BNT162, a series of vaccine candidates for COVID-19. BNT162 was initially four candidates developed by BioNTech, two candidates consisting of nucleoside modified mRNA-based (modRNA), one of uridine containing mRNA-based (uRNA), and the fourth candidate of self-amplifying mRNA-based (saRNA). Pre-clinical results of the modRNA candidate BNT162b2&nbsp;posted&nbsp;to the pre-print server&nbsp;bioRxiv&nbsp;showed the vaccine had &quot;protective anti-viral effects in rhesus macaques, with concomitant high neutralizing antibody titers and a TH1-biased cellular response in rhesus macaques and mice.&quot; The companies have selected BNT162b2 to move forward in a Phase 2/3 trial.\n\nRegulatory Actions: BNT162b was&nbsp;authorized by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for use in the UK&nbsp;on 2 December after a rolling review of vaccine data submitted by Pfizer and BioNTech.\n\nStudy Designs: The pivotal Phase 2/3 trial of about 32,000 healthy participants&nbsp;(NCT04368728) still is recruiting, as is a Phase 1/2 trial in the US and Germany of 200 healthy participants between aged 18-55 years (NCT04380701).&nbsp;Pfizer and BioNTech also are planning&nbsp;a combined Phase 1/2 trial of 160 participants between 20-85 years old (NCT04588480). In China, BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical are conducting a Phase 2 trial of BNT162b in 960 healthy participants at the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NCT04649021).\n\nOutcomes: On 9 November, Pfizer and BioNTech&nbsp;announced&nbsp;interim results by press release of 94 Phase 3 trial participants, which showed BNT162b2 was more than 90% effective in protecting participants who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days after the second dose. Those results are backed up by Phase 1&nbsp;data&nbsp;published in&nbsp;The New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;showing similar immunogenicity between BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 but fewer adverse effects with BNT162b2. Another study of Phase 1/2 data for BNT162b1 was&nbsp;published&nbsp;in the journal&nbsp;Nature. Robust immunogenicity was seen after vaccination at all three doses (10 &mu;g, 30 &mu;g and 100 &mu;g). Adverse events were elevated at the highest dose; therefore, participants did not receive a second dose at that level. Participants in Phase 1/2 trials who received two doses between 1 and 50 &micro;g of BNT162b1 had &quot;robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses,&quot; according to a paper&nbsp;published&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nature&nbsp;on 30 September.\n\nStatus: In the US,&nbsp;Pfizer and BioNTech have requested that the FDA issue an EUA for BNT162b2; an advisory committee meeting is scheduled for 10 December. BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 received&nbsp;FDA Fast Track designation for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. The companies requested conditional marketing authority from EMA on 1 December; EMA&#39;s rolling&nbsp;review&nbsp;of BNT162b2 could accelerate that authorization.&nbsp;In Australia, BNT162b2 received&nbsp;provisional determination&nbsp;from Australia&rsquo;s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is the first step on the road for approval for the vaccine in the country. BioNTech&#39;s partner in China, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group,&nbsp;announced&nbsp;it is seeking approval for BNT162b2 in China but would no longer be pursuing clinical trials for BNT162b1.",

      "details": "Background: mRNA-1273 was developed by Moderna based on prior studies of related coronaviruses such as those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nStudy Design: A Phase 3 trial of 30,000 participants at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection is underway. Participants will receive a 100 &micro;g dose of mRNA-1273 or placebo and then be&nbsp;followed for up to 2 years (COVE trial;&nbsp;NCT04470427). Moderna&nbsp;posted&nbsp;the full trial protocol for COVE on 17 September. Previously, a Phase 1 trial (NCT04283461) of 105 healthy participants provided the basis for Moderna&rsquo;s investigational new drug application (IND), which was successfully reviewed by the FDA and set the stage for Phase 2 testing. A Phase 2 trial of 600 healthy participants evaluating 25 &micro;g, 100 &micro;g, and 250 &micro;g dose levels of the vaccine was completed.&nbsp;(NCT04405076).\n\nOutcomes:\nHuman studies - An&nbsp;interim analysis of 95 participants in the Phase 3 COVE trial was released by Moderna on 16 November. The non-peer-reviewed data indicate mRNA-1273 has an efficacy of 94.5%. There were no severe cases of COVID-19 in the vaccinated group compared with 11 cases in the placebo group. Overall, the company said the vaccine was tolerated well with no &ldquo;significant safety concerns.&rdquo; Additionally, Phase 1 data&nbsp;published&nbsp;in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;showed mRNA-1273 successfully produced neutralizing antibody titers in 8 participants who received either 25 &micro;g or 100 &micro;g doses. The response was dose dependent in 45 participants across 25 &micro;g, 100 &micro;g, and 250 &micro;g dose levels. In participants with available antibody data, neutralizing antibody titers were on par with what has been seen in convalescent sera from people who have successfully fought off COVID-19. The vaccine also appears to be safe for older adults, with participants who received two 25 &mu;g or 100 &mu;g doses of the vaccine experiencing mild or moderate effects consisting of fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and injection site pain, according to data from the Phase 1 trial&nbsp;published&nbsp;in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAnimal studies - Results from a challenge in a mouse model showed mRNA-1273 prevented viral replication in the lungs, and neutralizing titers in the mouse model were similar in participants receiving 25 &micro;g or 100 &micro;g doses of the vaccine. A&nbsp;study&nbsp;of nonhuman primates challenged with SARS-CoV-2 published in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;had neutralizing activity, and limited inflammation and lung activity after being administered the vaccine. A paper&nbsp;published&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nature&nbsp;also showed mRNA-1273 induced neutralizing antibodies in mice.\n\nStatus: Moderna requested that the FDA issue an EUA for mRNA-1273 on 30 November; an advisory committee meeting is scheduled for 17 December. Moderna requested conditional marketing authorization from EMA for mRNA-1273 on 1 December. On 12 May, the&nbsp;FDA granted&nbsp;Fast Track designation to mRNA-1273. A Phase 3 trial of the vaccine is&nbsp;underway, which is being funded by Operation Warp Speed. The UK&rsquo;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has&nbsp;begun&nbsp;a real-time review of mRNA-1273, which will allow a quicker approval process for the vaccine. A rolling review by regulator Swissmedic in Switzerland has also begun.",

Outcomes: A single dose of Ad5-nCoV protected against upper respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets, according to a paper published 14 August in Nature Communications. Results from a Phase 1 trial show a humoral and immunogenic response to the vaccine, according to a paper published in The Lancet. Adverse reactions such as pain (54%), fever (46%), fatigue (44%), headache (39%), and muscle pain (17%) occurred in 83% of patients in the low and medium dose groups and 75% of patients in the high dose group. In the Phase 2 trial, neutralizing antibodies and specific interferon Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses were observed at all dose levels for most participants. Status: On 25 June, Chinaâs Central Military Commission announced the military had been approved to use Ad5-nCoV for a period of 1 year, according to reporting in Reuters.",

It has been implicated in helping to combat other infections outside TB by boosting the immune system to fight similar infections. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;reported&nbsp;the BCG vaccine may be effective against leprosy and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as buruli ulcer disease. Other papers have posited the vaccine is effective in preventing acute&nbsp;respiratory tract infections&nbsp;in elderly patients, other&nbsp;respiratory infection and sepsis. A non-peer reviewed paper posted in March 2020 on the preprint server medRxiv has suggested countries with BCG vaccination programs at childhood are&nbsp;faring better&nbsp;in the fight against COVID-19 compared with countries that do not require BCG vaccination. Trials: BCG vaccines are being studied in the randomized, controlled, Phase 3 BRACE trial, which aims to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers in hospitals in Australia (NCT04327206). Researchers in The Netherlands launched the randomized, parallel-assignment, phase 3 BCG-CORONA trial on 31 March and plan to enroll 1,500 healthcare workers to receive the BCG vaccine or placebo (NCT04328441). The Faustman Lab is currently evaluating the BCG vaccine&rsquo;s effectiveness in&nbsp;type 1 diabetes&nbsp;and is seeking funding to launch a trial to assess whether the vaccine helps prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers, according to&nbsp;independent reporting&nbsp;from the&nbsp;New York Times. Outcomes: A paper published in Science Advances found countries that required BCG vaccination until the year 2000 had significantly slower growth rates of COVID-19 compared with countries that did not mandate the vaccine. In The Journal of Clinical Investigation published in November 2020, researchers found healthcare workers with the BCG vaccine had \"decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms.\" However, a birth cohort study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found the BCG tuberculosis vaccine did not have a protective effect against COVID-19 in more than 1 million individuals born in Sweden who received the vaccine. A letter published in the journal PNAS where researchers analyzed mortality rates in countries with higher rates of BCG vaccination such as Bolivia, Panama, Columbia, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany found that the negative association between the BCG vaccination and COVID-19 related deaths appears to be diminishing. Status: Trials are still currently recruiting.",

The vaccine is injected intradermally through a device which Inovio plans to scale production of while they wait for study results. Preclinical data were published in Nature Communications and showed that mice and guinea pigs who received INO-4800 demonstrated neutralizing antibodies as well as humoral and T-cell responses. In guinea pigs, researchers observed protein binding antibody titers and blocking of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Study Design: As of 28 April, the company had enrolled 40 healthy volunteers in a a non-randomized, open label Phase 1 (NCT04336410) trial, according to a&nbsp;press release. Participants were to receive one or two intradermal injections (1.0 mg) of INO-4800 at baseline and at 4 weeks, followed by electroporation. A Phase 2/3 trial, dubbed INNOVATE, has begun, with the Phase 2 portion of the trial enrolling up to 400 participants who will receive 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg doses of the vaccine or placebo in a two-dose regimen. Outcomes: On 30 July, Inovio reported positive results from a trial where rhesus macaques received INO-4800 and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2. After 4 months, durable antibody and T cell responses were observed in the animals as well as memory T and B cell responses. Status: On 16 April, Inovio, the Center for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI)&nbsp;announced&nbsp;they are working with the&nbsp;Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in South Korea. In a press release, Inovio said early results from the vaccine showed immune responses in nearly all Phase 1 trial participants, noting that INO-4800 also inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Plans for a Phase 2/3 trial were put on hold on 28 September by FDA questions about vaccine's delivery device. Inovio expects  to answer FDA by October, the company said.",
